How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

---well, it provided an easy way to see what lines ewre added and what lines were deleted, and thus I didn't have to search the entire document for and compare each line
    

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

---version control seems to save a lot of time, and of course that makes
you more efficient  

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Less cluttering, Google docs makes it likelier to save more versions 
    than you need, manual committing gives us a lot of flexibility, but 
    it is prone to user error and misuse.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because in git the files are much more likely to be interrelated, but in google docs each file can function more or less seperatly

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You use git log to see all of the diferent versions that vere committed and you use diff to see the difference between the versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Yes, because it gives me the oppertunity to go compleatly back in time
    and explore and break as I want

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For example this web programming project I need to send in
